# Product Sales Analysis(Monthly)

This sales data analysis project entails analyzing a company's sales data and indicating profit by product, sales, and other significant factors that might influence the company's performance.

The data set must be connected to Power BI Desktop to remove irrelevant data before visualizing and exporting the filtered data as dashboards. The dashboard could leverage Power BI visualization types such as KPI Cards, Bar Charts, Doughnut Charts, Tables, Page Navigation through buttons, etc.
